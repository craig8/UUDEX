            msg = "UUDEX describes a communications architecture and protocol suite used to allow organizations to exchange data and information necessary for reliable and secure operations of an energy delivery system. It can also be used within an organization to facilitate movement of data between control centers.  UUDEX does not consider data exchange between a control center and field equipment, or data exchanges within field sites. Data transferred using UUDEX is described using a modeling language that allow for flexibility and expandability. Models can be developed for existing electric power system data communications, following the Common Information Model (CIM, or IEC 61970), that allows different computer systems to transfer power system information between them without knowing the internal structures of the communications partner.  By using a model-based architecture, modifications and additions can be designed and implemented with minimal impact to any existing data transfers. Using common names from the CIM also allow different systems to be able to coordinate exchanged data with minimal manual coordination, which will significantly reduce the resources and time necessary to modify existing communications links, or add new logical connections. The model-based approach also allows UUDEX to be expanded to serve as a transport for other data by either adopting existing modes (e.g., STIX/TAXII), or creating new models (e.g., RCIS). Models could be widely disseminated (e.g., OE-417 reporting), or used by a specific group of connections (e.g., in a regional market). For organizations in the electricity sector, Figure 1 shows a high-level overview of the potential uses of UUDEX between electric sector organizations described by the NERC functional model. In the figure, the solid lines show logical communications that take place between the control centers or centralized control systems of various organizations that are within scope of UUDEX, while the dashed lines show communications between organizationâ€™s control centers and field devices which are out of scope for UUDEX. Not all communications interactions are shown in the figure, but it is clear that a significant number of existing communications interactions could make use of UUDEX. UUDEX could be applied to communications within other energy sectors, such as oil and gas delivery systems in a similar manner. UUDEX can also be used for communications between utility organizations and other non-utility organizations, including government organizations and commercial enterprises. For example, UUDEX could be used for communications between a utility organization and its Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), the E-ISAC for the electricity sector. It could also be used to communication event and outage information to the Department of Energy (DOE) following the requirements of the OE-417 reporting criteria.  It could be used to coordinate information dissemination about line outage."
